Q.Everytime you add a new user, the older user gets removed.
Why does this happen any ideas. Write the reason in the answer.

Ans:Because we store the userdata as an object in local storage.
Now local storage stores the data in key:value format.
So every time we add userdata ,we update value of the same key.
So the old user data is replaced by new user data.So at any time 
we able to store only one userdata.
